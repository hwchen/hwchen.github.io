  <h1>Turning a corner</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 25, 2014</span>
      <p>Feels like I&rsquo;m turning a corner! I think that I&rsquo;m starting to feel the possibility of putting projects together now.</p>

<p>I think a large part of this is simply volume of code. I finished 50 problems on Project Euler (Yay!), which involved a lot of good repetition. I especially became comfortable with the use of higher-order functions. And from the repetition, I&rsquo;m beginning to see how I would want to organize bigger programs. As usual, not something that I can really understand by reading a book, but it grows organically out of the process of learning. I&rsquo;m beginning to see my own preferences for how to break up functions, when to use algebraic data types.</p>

<p>The other part was finally getting motivated to do some real-world programming for the MGA ladder. I wrote a small program for computing ladder standings, and for updating files to the ftp server. I mucked around in the plumbing of doing IO and ftp stuff, and found that it wasn&rsquo;t really that hard. Then, today I re-found some old tutorials on building an <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot">IRC bot</a> and an interpreter (<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours">Write Yourself A Scheme</a>). Suddenly, not so imposing! Two months ago they would have seemed really imposing!</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m comfortable with things like functors and applicatives yet. I understand them theoretically, but I see now that I will need to apply them in practial contexts to really get it. So, I just need to code more! Judging from how I feel after Project Euler, I don&rsquo;t need to code much bigger projects. In fact, that might be counter-productive. Instead, lots of smaller projects that feel good to finish, and now more variety might be nice.</p>
