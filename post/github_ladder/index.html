  <h1>Github and Ladder</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Jan 4, 2015</span>
      <p>Today, my friend Andrew was kind enough to take me through some of the basics of Git and Github.</p>

<p>For the MGA ladder, we&rsquo;re going to set up some software to help manage recording and displaying of results. Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll also get automatic submission of rated games to the AGA.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already written some <a href="https://github.com/hwchen/ladder-hs">utilities</a> in Haskell to automate updating of the ladder site, using a markdown -&gt; pandoc -&gt;html -&gt; upload to site. So what used to take me 5 minutes now only takes me less than a minute! Maybe not that much absolute time saved, in the grand scheme of things, but I savor every keystroke I save (and especially point and clicks).</p>

<p>The software that Andrew and I are starting will eventually be much more ambitious. Instead of working just on flat files as a data store, and manually running a program to convert results to a website, we&rsquo;ll be using flask to set up a web framework with a database.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s first major step was to get a workflow so that we could cooperate on the project. Github is one of the go-tos for collaboration, but it&rsquo;s pretty complicated for a novice. Fortunately, Andrew has a lot of experience with Git for his sofware engineering work. I learned about forking, the difference between upstream and origin (and master), and how to use branches. We stepped through our planned workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create local branch</li>
<li>Commit and push local branch to origin branch</li>
<li>Pull request from origin branch to upstream master (currently massgo/mgaladder)</li>
<li>After review and merge, then merge changes back to origin and local masters (in whatever preferred order).</li>
</ol>

<p>We also covered some tools that would be helpful for using Git, like some options for Git log that would enable visualization of branches. I&rsquo;m also planning on installing the Hub tool.</p>

<p>So, a lot for my brain to take in today. Git is very powerful and flexible, and lots of thanks to Andrew for his help. I don&rsquo;t think I could have figured this out in even a day on my own, and we spent just one hour.</p>

<p>I can see why Git experience in particular is a highly requested skill for software developers. It&rsquo;s not just a &ldquo;version control&rdquo; (in perhaps the back-up sense), it&rsquo;s a very powerful coordination software that makes very large engineering projects possible.</p>
