  <h1> New Journey</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 2, 2014</span>
      

<p>I&rsquo;m starting a new episode in my life! About one month ago, I committed myself
to learning programming and getting a job as a software developer. For at least
the next five years, I want to learn some new skills and explore a new
industry. After that, I&rsquo;ll reassess and see where I want to go next.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Learning Programming</h3>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve learned Python through Think Python by Allen Downey, which I think
is an excellent book. I appreciated the thoughtful exercises, and the focus on
teaching only what&rsquo;s useful in the moment while building towards a bigger
project. I find that too much information without implementation results in
shallow learning. Perhaps for other learners, there&rsquo;s a different sweet spot,
but for me Think Python worked great. I&rsquo;m even planning on working through his
book Think Complexity.</p>

<p>With some Python basics under my belt, I&rsquo;m investigating some other projects.
The way my brain works, the computational aspect of CS doesn&rsquo;t seem daunting,
but the organizational part does. For example, data structures in a void make sense, but
what&rsquo;s the best way to organize them to do something useful? I guess this is
the software engineering side, and it looks quite open-ended and complex.</p>

<p>My current plans for Python projects are basic inventory management from CLI
and to investigate Flask. However, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m not very results
driven, I&rsquo;m more of a process person. Of course, getting something to work is
satisfying, but I feel uncomfortable with magic and frameworks at the moment
because I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on. So as I continue to explore, those
projects may never get finished.</p>

<p>On the theme of less magic, I&rsquo;ve also been investigating Golang. I&rsquo;ve finally
got it set up, and done some tutorials. I like the simplicity of the language,
and I want to use it to build a simple webserver first. Perhaps to serve sgf
files (Go game records).</p>

<p>There is, of course, a ton of other stuff I also find interesting: SICP,
Haskell, algorithms, data mining and analyis, numerical computing and
modelling. I&rsquo;m all too capable of running off in many different directions. So
I&rsquo;m going to shelve those for now and concentrate on Python and Golang.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Finding a Job</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been networking with Williams alumni and they&rsquo;ve been very kind and
helpful. I may have an internship set up for the near future, and I&rsquo;ll also be
looking for other opportunities through more networking. I&rsquo;ve found that my
default of responding to Craigslist ads has not worked especially well, maybe
because of my unconventional background. Although, I&rsquo;m also planning on sending
some cold emails.</p>
