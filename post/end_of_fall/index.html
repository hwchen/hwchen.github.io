  <h1>End of Fall</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 15, 2014</span>
      

<p>It&rsquo;s the end of the fall (and almost the end of the year) and I&rsquo;m still looking. I&rsquo;m actually fairly optimistic, though. I hope to have some nice projects up in time for the new year, I feel like I&rsquo;ll have some good chances then.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been growing my skills a lot, it just takes a lot of time. At least for me, it&rsquo;s difficult to learn by just blasting away at a complex project for a couple of weeks. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of smaller bits of code, especially Project Euler, while also investigating some larger scale stuff. I&rsquo;m going to write a program to help me manage the MGA ladder, because that&rsquo;s a pretty big pain point (I hate repetitive data entry tasks!).</p>

<p>I think in terms of learning, I&rsquo;ve gotten to a point where books will actually be useful to me now. I just had to do a lot of coding in whatever my way my brain wanted to, now I have a jumping off point for understanding more interesting stuff. So I&rsquo;m going to go through LYAH again, and I&rsquo;ve ordered the data processing cookbook by Shuklan.</p>

<p>I tried to use books before, but they felt too &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; which I guess was my brain&rsquo;s code that I couldn&rsquo;t internalize the information in a useful way. I&rsquo;ve read some stuff that said that writing code is most important for beginners (even if it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;good code&rdquo;), and then reading more code is more important later. I think I was prematurely optimizing a bit, thinking about how to make my code &ldquo;good&rdquo; and thinking about clean code. Even in Haskell, I can do quite a bit without understanding all the higher level concepts.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Social Learning</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started going through algorithms and data structure with a friend from the Go club. I think that it&rsquo;s going to be super helpful. I forget if I mentioned it in a previous post, but I&rsquo;m realizing that I&rsquo;m a very social learner. While I do like to read, most of the integration comes from talking with others. And not just listening, it has to be interactive. I think that&rsquo;s why it felt easy to learn Go and martial arts: lots of social feedback.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed that online classes don&rsquo;t really do it for me. It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to sit passively through a lecture now. So, I won&rsquo;t be doing a lot of online courses on my own, although I&rsquo;ll probably pick up bits and pieces here and there, and I might go through exercises with a friend.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to apply this newfound knowledge! Less &ldquo;trying to figure things out on my own,&rdquo; more looking for like-minded people for all the things I want to learn: yoga, martial arts, Go, programming, languages. (I think that at this point in my life, I&rsquo;m also just less embarassed about what I don&rsquo;t know or can&rsquo;t do).</p>
