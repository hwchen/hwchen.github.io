&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;I got a new job!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be working as a software developer! I also found a great place to land. Good energy, good people, get things done, and very encouraging towards my development as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn a lot about web application architecture in Nodejs and Python. The product also has electronic device components, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to learn how the devices and the network connect all together with web back-end and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m also planning on continuing my Haskell education. It&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of fun, and provides some amazingly powerful tools for structuring programs. On my shortlist for reading: Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell; Practical Vim; and Concrete Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even while I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching myself to code, it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to maintain focus and and finish projects. At work, I already feel like it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to buckle down on a program. I think programming for an external purpose will help me just keep going and practice more. And that will help keep me disciplined and motivated for my own more &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really feel like I&amp;rsquo;m moving forward! I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see where this job will take me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also, just to insert a piece of code in here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does &lt;code&gt;replicateM 2 [1, 3]&lt;/code&gt; give the output it does?)&lt;/p&gt;
